# FileOrganizer
Python script to organize my local file system

This script uses the os, shutil and datetime libraries to organize my local filesystem according to my needs for content creation and other purposes. 

There are 3 functions I created to help me do this. 

  1) Organize Files By Date and Extension
     
       This function puts files into folders grouped by extension (case insensitive) and date.
       This helps when I airdrop recorded videos for social media to my laptop so I don't have randomly named videos throughout my Downloads folder.
     
  2) Organize Files By Name
     
       This function helps me group files with certain keywords in their names into folders.
       I can use it for specific words (e.g. all my logos in a Logos folder) or as a catch-all (see the last function call with more than 10 fitness keywords).
  3) Organize Files By Extension
     
       This function puts files with the same extension into the specified folder.
       I use this to organize b reel content like gifs and images into one folder.
